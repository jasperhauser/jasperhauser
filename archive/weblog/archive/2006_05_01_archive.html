        Last friday <a href="http://thetreehouseandthecave.blogspot.com/">Andrew Coulter</a>, the designer and "<a href="http://thetreehouseandthecave.blogspot.com/2004/12/dissatisfaction-sows-innovation.html">inventor</a>" of <a href="http://www.steelskies.com/coverflow/">Coverflow</a>, did two great posts on the future visual presentation of Coverflow.<br /><br />He created a custom disk image icon and a custom disk image background to give the application a much more proffesional look and feel. He also did a great more in depth post about the creation of the icon and the cover art he created for the icon, showing high resolution versions of his art. Andrew is clearly a gifted graphic designer.<br /><br />I really hope the guys will further improve and develop their already wonderfull application.

     <div class="textpost">
        <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> products are rarely leaked, so I was a bit surprised to see <a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0605powerschool2.html">Dashcode being distributed on the web</a>. It's not a big surprise to see this app, as there have been screenshots of it on the web for <a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0511dashcode.html">very long already</a>.<br /><br />In the early days of 2005 I was working with <a href="http://www.appzapper.com/">Austin Sarner</a> on a project called <a href="http://www.jasperhauser.nl/weblog/images/widgetkit_ui.jpg">WidgetKit</a>, which was intended to be similar to the then non-existent DashCode. Austin decided to stop actively developing it as he figured it wasn't an app that would sell well enough. Never the less, the application icon for WidgetKit was made.<br /><br />I just can't keep myself from being a bit surprised by the fact that the Dashcode icon from Apple resembles the WidgetKit icon I made closely. I'm not accusing anybody here, since I have no idea when the icon was created, and it really doesn't matter, but the similarity is striking none the less.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.jasperhauser.nl/weblog/images/widget_dash.jpg" class="post" /><br /><br />One of the most important things I learned while creating application icons is to use visual differentiation. When starting on a project I always take some time to look at similar applications and their icons to see what I could and should not create. I tend to look at strong visual elements I can use, and I look for key attributes I should stay away from. The important thing is to ensure that your icon doesn't resemble a competing application's icon, but there is no need either to reinvent the wheel for every icon. It is important to stay away from a situation where users could become confused about about what application they are looking at. That also explains why it's so difficult to create a "new" icon for applications such as word processors and image editors, since there must be hundreds already.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.jasperhauser.nl/weblog/2006/05/history-of-camino-application-icon.html">working on the Camino application icon</a> I was confronted with a similar situation. On the one hand, I wasn't one of the biggest fans of the Chimera icon, but I knew that I couldn't make yet another globe/sphere-ish or compass like icon. Too many other browsers already used that style, which meant that using it would create a situation where users no longer would be able to distinguish it from the other browsers.<br /><br />The same applies to the work I did on the <a href="http://www.jasperhauser.nl/weblog/2005/11/small-history-of-camino-interface.html">Camino toolbar icons</a>. The goal was to enable users to differentiate the application not only from the application icon but also from the toolbar icons. Users that have requested for Camino to use more Safari/OmniWeb/FireFox like icons don't understand the underlying problem.<br /><br />When creating icons and an interface for any project, you want the ensure that what you make will fit within the system's look and feel, but will also differentiate the application from other applications.<br /><br />A group of applications that would all use the same toolbar icons, window style, and window layout would be very annoying as users would no longer be able tell at a glance what is what. It's a difficult balance to maintain, and it's one of those things that make icon design so much harder than people think.<br /><br />The differentiarion rule also explains why Apple isn't afraid of trying new interface looks every time they release a new version of their <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx">Mac OS</a> or <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife">iLife</a> suite. They know that visual differentiation between applications allows the user to find his/her way through the system. Too many people think that that the User Interface Guidelines are a law, but in reality it's nothing more then a "guideline" or a rather good starting point.<br /><br /><strong>Update:</strong> I just uploaded an screenshot of the UI of <a href="http://www.jasperhauser.nl/weblog/images/widgetkit_ui.jpg">WidgetKit</a>. Some have asked me if we ever released WidgetKit, the answer as written in the text is no. Oh and please do not hesitate to comment on grammer and spelling improvents ;)<br /><br /><strong>Update 2:</strong> Perhaps I should have clarified two things from the start. On the one hand Apple could have known that I created an icon that looked similar to Dashcode because it's been on my icon website since last year. But I don't expect them to check every website to see if anybody made something similar and like I indicated, it doesn't matter because WidgetKit never came out as a product. On the other hand I do think that Apple did less of a good job at differentiating the Dashcode icon from the xCode icon. I for one added a big page curl, I used a tool that clearly has a different shape, angle, and placement. But I left it out because I didn't think it was interesting.</strapplications>

     <div class="textpost">
        In the summer of 2005 I first read about the <a href="http://www.steelskies.com/coverflow">CoverFlow project</a>, a colaboration between <a href="http://thetreehouseandthecave.blogspot.com/">Andrew Coulter</a> and <a href="http://www.steelskies.com/">Jonathan del Strother</a>. The arcticle sounded very promising and so I was immediatly intrigued.<br /><br />Andrew did <a href="http://thetreehouseandthecave.blogspot.com/2004/12/dissatisfaction-sows-innovation.html">a blog post</a> in December 2004 describing his idea for a new way to go trough an iTunes digital music library. In what I would call a perfect colaboration Jonathan decided to write the application Andrew described. The result is simply astounding, and it's potential still remains to be discovered by many I believe. The idea of being able to visually and easily <strong>flip</strong> trough your album collection covers, in a way that's completly in sync with how we do it in real life, is just amazing.<br /><br />As you might know I enjoy helping out project with potential (<a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org">Camino</a>, <a href="http://www.adiumx.org">Adium</a>, <a href="http://www.gnustep.org">GNUstep</a>) to ensure that their visual representation re-enforces the product as a whole. In the case of CoverFlow their wasn't any work needed on the prestine interface Andrew and Jonathan created, instead the application really lacked a very good application icon. So that's what I went and made for them.<br /><img src="http://www.jasperhauser.nl/weblog/images/coverflow_stages.jpg" title="Coverflow Stages" class="post"><br />Given the fact that it's just a tool enabling you to find things in a visual way, the icon needed a similar simple approach. It needed to be something that was as visually appealing and smart as the whole applications mataphor and interface. The descision to do the DJ record flight case was made quickly, mainly because that's where the project inspiration came from in the first place.<br /><br />While working on the icon I came up with the idea to dynamically load the users currently playing albumm cover and composit it on the icon in the dock. It's a small detail but in the bigger picture it just lifts application to a whole new level of sophistication. This is something Jonathan is looking into, it's not yet implemeted sorry, but it should come soon.<br /><img src="http://www.jasperhauser.nl/weblog/images/coverflow_covers.jpg" title="Andrews Covers" class="post"><br />Another nice detail is that while normally I do all the work on the icon, I invited Andrew to create all the album cover designs for the icon. Andrew is a graphic designer and so I thought it would be a nice idea to merge some of his work in the icon aswell. And I must say that I really like the way it turned out. Collaborations like these should happen more often.<br /><a href="http://www.jasperhauser.nl/weblog/files/coverflow.icns.zip" class="imagelink"><img src="http://www.jasperhauser.nl/weblog/images/coverflow_big.jpg" title="big Preview of the icons"  class="post"></a><br />I'd like to thank Jonathan and Andrew for creating such a wonrderfull application. And I would like to urge them to further develop it. I have the destinct feeling that this way of browsing visual instances is more powerfull then they thought.<br /><br />For those who can't wait for the Jonathan to update the build with the new icon I prepared a <a href="http://www.jasperhauser.nl/weblog/files/coverflow.icns.zip">.icns file you can use to use the icon now</a>! Have fun.

        In continuation of my previous article on <a href="http://www.jasperhauser.nl/weblog/2005/11/small-history-of-camino-interface.html">the history of the camino interface</a> I thought it would be interesting to write a bit about the application icon. The visual point of recognition of every icon. Every once in a while a burst of critique arises from the Camino user groups concerning the Camino application icon. Heck the critique has been there from the start. Goes to show how well people like even the slightest change ;) <blockquote>I just landed jasper's updated icon set, available to all the next time we get a working nightly (still prodding people about that, progress is being made).<br /><br />Thanks again to Jasper for all his hard work and openness to comment. I sent him back to the drawing board (literally) more times than I could have handled were I in his shoes. Nevertheless he stuck with it and produced something that I think everyone can agree is a huge step in the right direction. Just try to keep that in mind when you're thrashing the new look :) - <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/pinkerton/">Mike Pinkerton</a></blockquote> Based on feedback the main <i>issue</i> seems to be that people think the icon "is too small". But fact is that that's just a perceived issue. The icon uses the full 128/128 pixels canvas. As shown in the images below all 3 use the same square 128 pixel canvas, non the less the first icon seems to be much smaller. The issues is caused by the spikes, resulting in a smaller surface actually being used by the icon.<br /><img src="http://www.jasperhauser.nl/weblog/images/camino_icon_size.gif" class="post" /><br />This also shows why so many icons either have a square or circle as their base shape. Those shapes just make very good use of the canvas, that's for sure something of great importance for an icon. On the other hand it does create a situation where the Camino icon stands out in the Dock because it appears to be smaller. We can argue that this is an issue or we can say that it's unique property of the Navigator/Chimera/Camino icon shape.<br /><br />When, 2 years ago, I started working on creating the new look of what is now know as the "Camino 1.0 theme" redoing the application icon was a major part of the effort. Early on I also had the same problems with the icon, I argued we could use the canvas much more efficient. But the main problem in creating a new and unique icon for a web-browser lies in the fact that so many have already been made. And most of the obvious visual metaphors had already been used. Prior to the release of Apple's Safari, I had already made a compass icon for Camino. It was very bad and was certainly not the first. But it was the only really good visual metaphor left for a browser. Finding a new icon metaphor or logo for such a common application is really really hard. Since Apple had already released Safari we didn't have much choose other sticking with the icon Ugo Dantas De Santana made for Camino back when it was called Navigator.<br /><br />To be honest I had really hoped I could come up with a stunning new icon for Camino but that thought was quietly smothered by Mike Pinkerton. Initially I had my doubts about his arguments, but looking back I think it was the best way to go.<br /><br />You have to keep in mind that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino">Navigator/Chimera was the first amazingly fast browser</a> for the then very young Mac OS X platform. Most of the people who used Mac OS X in those days knew or used Navigator/Chimera one time or another. The application had a reputation and was well known. And that application had always had the same globe/compass combo icon.<br /><br />When you have such an established picture mark you just don't switch to something else, especially considering the fact that nobody else used such a unique icon shape. Changing would be like <a href="http://www.goodlogo.com/cases/mcdonalds/">McDonalds</a> choosing a new font for their M that would have spiked arches instead of round ones. Or Apple taking out the bite of their <a href="http://www.syncmag.com/article2/0,1895,1887818,00.asp">apple</a> logo. You just don't change the unique shape attributes that create the distinct visual identity of the logo. Accept of-course if the logo is so bad you just don't have any other choose. But that wasn't the case. So instead we choose for redoing the icon from scratch keeping only the unique shape as a base.<br /><img src="http://www.jasperhauser.nl/weblog/images/camino_ps.jpg" class="post" /><br />We tried a lot of things before we came to what we have now. We wanted a style that looked more like the style Apple introduced for Tiger (Mac OS X 10.4). We also wanted to get rid of the America's centric globe, and instead we choose for something that vaguely looks likes continents. (yes there here actually people who really didn't like america being in the icon). We also borrowed the <a href="http://www.apple.com/dotmac/">.Mac</a> globe look to emphasize the internet/network aspect of the application because only a small amount of people actually saw a compass in the icon. And finally most work went into creating all the sizes we needed of the icon. <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/community/promotion/">We actually have 1024 all the way down to a 16 square pixels versions of the icon</a>. That is a pretty huge size difference. And the hard part is making sure the 16px version looks/feels the same as the 1024px version.<br /><br />Only recently I introduced a monotone version of the icon. I created this icon mainly to have a simplified version that could be easily used on very small and solid colored canvases. Just using the base shape and an extra circle for the globe did the trick. It's so simple and yet works amazingly well, while still being recognizable as the camino icon. This version of the icon can be seen as the website icon, and on the .dmg icon and .dmg background image.<br /><img src="http://www.jasperhauser.nl/weblog/images/camino_icons.jpg" class="post" /><br />So you see how a thing that is perceived by some as a weakness, is actually the main strength of the icon. You just need to see and use it. There is always room for improvement but I think we succeeded quite well.

        <img src="http://www.jasperhauser.nl/weblog/images/imac20.jpg"><br />It was only 3 days after <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac">the presentation of the new Intel based iMac</a> that I placed my order. Why so soon I guess one could ask? Normally I tend to wait for a 2nd generation before I buy it, just like we should all do, but I took a chance knowing that Apple is very good at making reliable hardware.<br /><br />Ever since Apple said they would swicth to the intel processor I wanted to get my hands on one. The main reason for that was that I guessed I would finally be able to free myself of my dull litle box. I figured that the day I could run my windows system on the new intel imac where closing in. Especially since apple didn't do anything ground breaking to prevent it to be done technically. It was just a question of some one finding the way to hack it in.<br /><br />I gues you can imagine I was pleasantly surprised when Apple came out with <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp">Boot Camp</a>. I'd almost say I knew it was coming. I supported the <a href="http://onmac.net/">WinXpOnMac</a> effort alongside many others, but it was clear that it needed a lot of work before I would sacrifice my mac to that hack. And let it be heard that this mac hardware runs XP extremely well and fast. It's all I wished for and more.<br /><br />The Intel iMac is an amazing machine with even greater speed (I have the 20" version with the 256mb graphics card, and plenty of ram). Especially considering the fact that this is a consumer product and not a proffesional product, even thought in some cases it out performes the current pro products. That fact on itself makes the iMac all worth it.<br /><br />I had only 3 nuances with the machine, 2 have been fixed by Apple trough software and firmware updates.<br /><ol><li><a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=380801&tstart=0">Slow airport connection speed</a>. For some unclear reason the airport connection speed on the intel iMac was heavily weighed down. Many many users complained about it to apple, they never officialy responded. But non the less they fixed the problem in the recent 10.4.6 upgrade of OS X. It would have been nice if they told us what it was and how they fixed it.</li><li>The very first hour of usage the keyboard and mouse showed eratic behaviour. Now and then the mouse and Volume keys on the keyboard would stop responding. Fortunatly that issues somehow solved itself early on. Non the less Apple recently released new keyboard and mouse software.</li><li>For some reason the security screen that I have set to appear after a wake from sleep tends to have some render issue, showing the window pixels all scatttered and smeared over the top part of the screen.</li></ol><br />Particularly issue one bugged me as I had to transfer files to my iBook once in a while. But since it has been fixed, I really don't have any other "real" issues anymore.<br /><br />I'm still very excited about the machine! The sound qualty is surprisingly good and loud for such a compact housing. It looks awesome, the 20" screen is simply fantastic and OS X runs like a real tiger. What else could I wish for apart from an Intel native Adobe CS suite? To bad I need Boot Camp to run that at an acceptable speed ;) Bravo Apple for providing such a good product and such good service.<br /><br />Some other good reviews of the Intel iMac from: <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/hardware/imac-coreduo.ars">Arstechnica</a>, <a href="http://www.macworld.com/2006/01/features/imaclabtest1/index.php">Macworld</a>, <a href="http://www.macintouch.com/imacintel/review.html">Macintouch</a>.
