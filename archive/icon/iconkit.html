              of your application. This base icon kit will help improve your application

              contact with many small and large software developers and companies,
              and I know from this experience that starting a software project
              or company can be very hard for various reasons. Making sure the
              look and feel of the application is of high quality is one of them.
              That is why I created this special icon kit. The kit contains icons,
              I know from experience, you will most likely need. In the near
              future I will be providing some smaller and simple additional icon
              sets.
